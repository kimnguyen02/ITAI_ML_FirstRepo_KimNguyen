My Observations About the Iris Dataset
Dataset Overview:

Number of samples: [150]
Number of features: [4]
Number of classes: [3]
Key Findings from the Visualization:

[red dot = Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes]
[Setosa sepal length is higher then the 2 classes Virginica and versicolor]
[The minimum sepal length of virginica and verticolor started from 5cm while sepal length of setosa started from 3cm. ]
Questions for Further Investigation:

[Why Iris Setosa does not overlap with the other 2 classes ?]
[why the 2 sepal width of virginica and Versicolor overlaping ?]
Reflection: In 2-3 sentences, describe what you learned about using these tools.

Using Bar chart allow us to easy visualize different form of comparing data and extract information. Numpy take care of calculation and allow numerical representation though Visualization.
